## **Ex.No.9 – Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation**


**Reg No**: 212222040055

### **Aim**

To demonstrate the ability of text-to-video generation tools to reproduce an existing video by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the video and use these details to generate a video as close as possible to the original.


### **Procedure**

#### **1. Analyze the Generated Video**

Examine the video carefully and identify key visual and atmospheric components:

* **Objects/Subjects**: People walking with umbrellas, café windows, puddles.
* **Colors**: Warm lights, soft gray skies, reflections in water.
* **Textures**: Wet cobblestone streets, soft rain.
* **Lighting**: Warm, glowing, soft ambient lighting from windows.
* **Background**: A small European town at night.
* **Composition**: Slow panning camera, reflections captured in puddles.
* **Style**: Realistic with cinematic aesthetics.



#### **2. Create the Basic Prompt**

Initial basic description:

> "A cozy rainy evening in a European town."


#### **3. Refine the Prompt with More Detail**

Refined version with enriched details:

> "A cozy rainy evening in a small European town — cobblestone streets glistening under soft rain, warm lights glowing from café windows, people walking with colorful umbrellas, and soft piano music in the background. The camera pans slowly, capturing reflections in puddles and the serene ambiance of a peaceful night."


#### **4. Identify Style and Artistic Influences**

* **Style**: Realistic with slight cinematic tones.
* **Mood**: Serene, cozy, peaceful.
* **Influence**: Inspired by romantic European evening scenes.



#### **5. Adjust and Fine-tune**

Final refined version for maximum realism:

> "A cozy, cinematic rainy evening in a charming European town — glistening cobblestone streets reflecting soft rain, glowing café windows casting warm light, people strolling with colorful umbrellas, subtle fog in the air, and ambient soft piano music. Camera pans slowly, capturing reflections in puddles and the quiet beauty of the scene."


#### **6. Generate the Video**

Used a text-to-video generation model (e.g., Pika Labs) to render the scene based on the final prompt.


#### **7. Compare the Generated Video with the Original**

* **Match Strengths**:

  * Accurately captured warm lighting, ambiance, umbrellas, and reflections.
  * Realistic textures and composition.
* **Minor Differences**:

  * Slight variations in facial expressions or number of people.
  * Music was ambient but not customizable.



### **🛠 Tools/Models Used**

* **Model**: Pika Labs (text-to-video AI tool)

### **Deliverables**

* **Original Video**: Provided as reference.
* **Generated Video**: Created using the refined prompt.
* **Prompt Used**: Documented above.
* **Comparison Report**: Analysis of visual fidelity and accuracy in reproduction.



### **Conclusion**

The experiment successfully demonstrated that detailed, thoughtful prompting enables AI-based video generation tools to closely recreate an existing video. By systematically analyzing the original content and iteratively refining the textual prompt, the generated video was able to capture the intended mood, setting, and visual composition. The result showcases the importance of prompt clarity and creative direction in producing visually accurate AI-generated content, valuable for use in storytelling, content creation, and simulation.
